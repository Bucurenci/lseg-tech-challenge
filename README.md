## Other information

The project has a few differences from your initial requirements because when I began working on it, I quickly went through the details and ended up using the image from the PDF as a reference for the model.

I would like to mention that the user can select the bot's options in two ways: by either clicking on one of the options from the last message or by typing the option's name in the chat input.

I have used the following technologies to build this project:

- React
- TypeScript
- SCSS
